## Description

For his Doomsday EP, me and Sonic Mayhem worked on two Max for Live devices and a Kontakt library that feature some of his sigurature sounds. These tools are now available to other artists and producers via the Doomsday Producers Edition, available on his online shop.

The Kontakt library includes drums, bass and lead instruments which were carefully sampled from Sonic Mayhem's own setup.

The OmegaSEQ device is a unique MIDI sequencer that includes features such as live transposition, smart velocity randomization and a special tension mode.

The AlphaDTR device is an audio effect that combines chebyshev distortion and a bitcrusher to completely destroy incoming sounds.
