This is another custom MIDI controller developed for a tech company interactive installation.

The controller features a custom firmware, 3 large faders (ALPS 130mm 10KB), and an LED ring on top of the controller that changes colors depending on the user interaction.

Since the controller was part of a larger setup, additional software was developed to convert the MIDI output to OSC and send it to other computers in a network via web sockets.

I also 3D modeled a custom case with VESA mount which could be mounted to the custom base or any VESA support.
