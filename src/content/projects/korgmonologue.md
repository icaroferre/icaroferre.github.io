A pack containing 100 presets for the Korg Monologue that I've created over the years is available on Korg's website.

These presets range from melodic presets (bass / lead) and FXs to drum sounds and entire sequences.

The Korg Monologue has always been one of my most used synthesizers and now everybody can have access to my favorite custom presets for free.
