## Description

Setlist is a Max for Live device that I've been actively developing for Strange Electronic since 2015. It's an incredible tool for playback engineers looking for an easier way to manage and play live sets.

It includes features such as support for OSC communication, Cycling 74's MIRA app, custom themes, search, auto-stop, list exporting, and more.

It has been used in many tours by artists such as Billie Eilish, Chance the Rapper, Logic, Kid Cudi, Lil Wayne, Mac Miller, Iggy Azaela, Drake, Wiz Khalifa and many others.
