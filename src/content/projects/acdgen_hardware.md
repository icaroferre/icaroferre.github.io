## Description

ACDGEN – Hardware Edition is a limited edition standalone hardware MIDI Pattern algorithmic generator that lets you use different algorithms to create 16th-note, acid-style, basslines and melodies with a push of a button and manipulate them live using the different parameters available. You can use ACDGEN to create anything from acid house basslines to lush synth arpeggios.
