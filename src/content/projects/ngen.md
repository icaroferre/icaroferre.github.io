NGEN is a unique 16-track MIDI sequencer design in São Paulo / Brazil that lets you combine multiple algorithmic / generative generators and MIDI FXs to sequence multiple hardware or software MIDI instruments.
It offers a completely new way of creating and performing music by abstracting the composition process. Instead of writing sequences from scratch, NGEN lets you quickly generate a new sequence for your drums, basslines, melodies, and chord progressions with a push of a button.

## Development of NGEN

After working on ACDGEN – Hardware Edition in 2019, I wanted to explore what else was possible in terms of hardware generative composition so I started working on a sequencer that was capable of running multiple instances of ACDGEN alongside other sequencers.

Before I started working on any MIDI generation, I spent the first couple of years of development working on all the different parts that would be needed such as MIDI implementation, a menu system, file management, and, most importantly, a way of switching between these algorithms in an embedded device.

After many PCB designs, firmware revisions, and prototypes, NGEN was released on January 19, 2023.
