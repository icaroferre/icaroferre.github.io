In 2018 I worked with Gui Boratto to build a custom light rig + software for some of the shows of the Pentagram album release tour.

The setup used 5 DMX lights, a Enttec DMX USB controller, and a custom Max for Live device built exclusively for this project. 

The M4L device let Gui Boratto sequence and control the light movements via MIDI and automatically sync them to his music.  
Another feature of this setup was the ability to form shapes (such as the pentagram) using narrow light beams. 

The rig was first used in the 2018 D'Edge Festival in SÃ£o Paulo city, Brazil.
