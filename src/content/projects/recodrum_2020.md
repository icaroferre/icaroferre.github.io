## Description

I was asked by [Arthur Joly](http://instagram.com/arthurjoly) / [RecoSynth](http://recosynth.com) to develop the circuit and firmware for the MIDI and trigger sequencer included in the New Recodrum.

The sequencer uses a custom PCB and an Arduino Mega and it includes features such as:

- XoX pattern editting 
- Quantized live recording
- Pattern selection (16 patterns stored on EEPROM)
- Track selection
- Live sequencer looping (hold FN and click on two steps to loop between them)
- Play mode
- Random sequence generation
- MIDI Input / Output
- Analog clock sync (4PPQN)
