For this project, I was approached by a marketing agency to develop a custom MIDI Controller for an ad campaign for a Brazilian bank. 

The main feature of this controller was the use of credit cards as drum pads which light up when pressed. It also included a horizontal fader and 4 knobs that could be mapped and used during a performance.

The custom PCB was designed to use a Teensy 4.0 as the main microcontroller, micro-switches for the pads, and a custom firmware developed exclusively for this project.
